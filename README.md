## Pre-requisite

1. Node/NVM

## Run Tests

1. Run `yarn` to install dependancies
1. Run `yarn test` to test the implementation with test scenarios

## Notes

I have allowed this function to not be tied with coordinates changing at same speed with time so it would output two coordinates in such scenarios (see last two test cases)
